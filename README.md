### How does it work ?

The ***#1*** rule in creating this application was to ***KEEP IT SIMPLE*** .<br>The challenge was to create the minimalistic, easy to use, no time consuming feedback tool.

Mr. Moody gathers feedback from all *REAL* users from the Slack team.

Each week we start a Campaign at the end of the week on Friday.

Feedback is based on one simple question: ***"How was your week ?"***

Giving feedback is as easy as one click.

All feedback is stored.

### Why this tool exist ?

[ ***X-Team*** ](http://x-team.com) cares for it's developers. We look at the feedback they provide and make sure they always answer :smiley:
